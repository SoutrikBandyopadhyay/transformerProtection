# transformerProtection
This is Mini Project of Group Number 2 of 4th Semester Electrical Engineering, IIEST Shibpur

This is the Arduino code for the project involving protection of a model of a distribution transformer from Over-Voltage, Over-Current and Excessive Temperature Rises. The Voltage and Current are measured using the Analog input pins of the Arduino Uno and the Temperature was measured using DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.
